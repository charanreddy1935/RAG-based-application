🏦 HDFC Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
📘 Overview

This project is an AI-powered financial assistant built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It helps users ask bank-related queries such as account details, loan information, credit card benefits, and general HDFC Bank policies — with accurate, context-aware responses generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system retrieves relevant information from official HDFC Bank documents / FAQs, and then generates human-like answers using an LLM.

🚀 Features

💬 Conversational chatbot that understands and answers financial queries.

📂 Document-aware responses using RAG (retrieves information from real HDFC data sources).

⚙️ Vector search with Chroma for fast retrieval.

🧠 Context management for multi-turn conversations.

🛡️ Prevents hallucination by grounding answers in real text data.

🏗️ Architecture

Data Ingestion → Collect and clean HDFC FAQs, policy PDFs, or website text.

Embedding & Indexing → Convert text into embeddings and store them in Chroma.

Retriever → On each user query, retrieve the top relevant chunks.

Generator → Use an LLM to generate a context-aware response using retrieved data.

User Query → Retriever → Relevant Docs → LLM (Generator) → Final Answer


💬 Example Queries

User: What is the minimum balance required for an HDFC savings account?
Bot: The minimum balance for a Regular Savings Account is ₹10,000 in metro/urban branches and ₹5,000 in semi-urban branches.

User: What are the interest rates on personal loans?
Bot: The personal loan interest rate ranges from 10.5% to 21%, depending on credit profile and loan amount.


🔒 Limitations

The chatbot responses are limited by the scope of uploaded HDFC data.

Real-time updates require re-embedding updated documents.

LLM performance depends on API model and cost limits.

💡 Future Enhancements

Add voice-based conversation using Speech-to-Text.

Integrate real HDFC API endpoints for live data.

Deploy on AWS / Hugging Face Spaces.

Add user authentication for personalized banking queries.
